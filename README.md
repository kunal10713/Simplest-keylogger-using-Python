# Simplest-keylogger-using-Python


A keylogger, sometimes called a keystroke logger or system monitor, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard.
It record the action of key. This key logger is made by Python language. Once we run the programme after that whatever we enter that is recorded and stored in log.txt file. We can read the key stroke by opening the log file.
